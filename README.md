# Gym Management CLI Application

This CLI application allows you to manage members, gym classes, and instructors in a gym database. It uses Python and SQLAlchemy to interact with a SQLite database (`gym.db`). With this application, you can create, update, delete, and search for members, classes, and instructors through the command line.

## Features
- **Manage Members**: Add, update, delete, and view gym members.
- **Manage Classes**: Create, update, delete, and view gym classes.
- **Manage Instructors**: Add, update, delete, and view instructors.
- **Relational Database**: Members are linked to gym classes, and gym classes are linked to instructors.
- **Validation**: Validates member email uniqueness and class and instructor existence before creating new records.
